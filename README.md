- 👋 Hi, I’m @ACBDias
- 👀 I’m interested in collaborative programming and consulting for the masses
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mathematics&programming for economic and organizational decision
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that share the power of information
- 📫 How to reach me: via github, we'll go from there if needed
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was around when man first stepped on the moon, and I'm still waiting for moonbases to appear, so never believe in what you hear: just believe in what you see and do.
